Topic: Errors vs. Defects

INSTRUCTIONS FOR STUDENTS:
1. This program contains ERRORS (prevent execution) and DEFECTS (wrong logic/results)
2. Identify each issue and classify it as ERROR or DEFECT
3. Fix all issues to make the program work correctly
4. Test with the provided test cases at the bottom

SCENARIO:
A simple banking system that allows deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Initial balance should be $1000
- Deposits must be positive amounts
- Withdrawals cannot exceed current balance
- Interest calculation: 5% annual interest on balance
- Transaction history should track all operations

ANSWER KEY FOR INSTRUCTORS:

ERRORS (Prevent Execution):
1. Line 20: Missing colon after if statement
2. Line 35: Typo in variable name 'balanse' â†’ 'balance'
3. Line 45: Wrong indentation before 'for' loop
4. Line 54: Missing closing parenthesis in function definition

DEFECTS (Allow Execution but Wrong Behavior):
5. Line 27: Wrong comparison (should be <=) to allow withdrawal of full balance
6. Line 40: Returns string instead of numeric value for balance
7. Line 51: Missing 'amount' parameter in withdraw() call
8. Line 68: Wrong comparison operator (< should be >=)

Total Issues: 8 (4 Errors + 4 Defects)
